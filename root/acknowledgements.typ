#blockquote[Great artists steal.]

Every component and style on this website is hand-crafted because web design is
an art, but it's an art I'm not very good at. So I've shamelessly bootlegged
countless design motifs off of cool websites made by much more talented people.
This page is my best effort to credit the people I've stolen designs from.

In no particular order:

- The snazzy lists on the #link("/")[main page] under "Contact" and
  "Places" were ripped off from
  #link("https://vlad.website/")[vlad.website]. I also stole the idea for the
  places tab from there.
- The selector on #link("CV")[my CV] is inspired by
  #link("https://muan.co/")[muan.co]'s language selector. My link
  styling is also stolen from her.
- The general typography borrows a lot of inspiration from Matthew Butterick's
  #link("https://practicaltypography.com/")[Practical Typography].

= Open source licenses

In addition to stolen designs, I've also used countless lines of free and open
source libraries and programs. In particular,

- #link("https://typst.app/")[Typst] converts markup to #smallcaps[html]. (Apache 2.0)
- #link("https://www.rust-lang.org/")[Rust] is what the entire site was written in. (MIT/Apache 2.0)
- The #link("https://crates.io/crates/hypertext")[hypertext crate] is what is used for #smallcaps(all: true)[HTML] templating. (MIT)
- #link("https://tailwindcss.com/")[Tailwind CSS] handles all the styling. (MIT)
- The site colors are inspired by #link("https://rosepinetheme.com/")[Rosé Pine]. (MIT)
- Icons are from #link("https://lucide.dev/icons/")[Lucide]. (ISC)

And, all of the #link("https://github.com/youwen5/web/blob/main/Cargo.lock")[
  other crates],
#link("https://github.com/youwen5/web/blob/main/web-components/pnpm-lock.yaml")[#smallcaps[npm]
  packages], Typst packages, and
#link("https://github.com/youwen5/web/blob/main/flake.lock")[Nix flakes].
