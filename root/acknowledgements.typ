#blockquote[Great artists steal.]

I've shamelessly bootlegged countless design motifs off of cool websites made
by much more talented people. This page is my best effort to credit the people
I've stolen designs from. (Though all the code was written by hand, by myself.)

In no particular order:

- The snazzy lists on the #link("/")[main page] under "Contact" and
  "Places" were ripped off from
  #link("https://vlad.website/")[vlad.website]. I also stole the idea for the
  places tab from there.
- The selector on #link("CV")[my CV] is inspired by
  #link("https://muan.co/")[muan.co]'s language selector. My link
  styling is also stolen from her.
- The general typography borrows a lot of inspiration from Matthew Butterick's
  #link("https://practicaltypography.com/")[Practical Typography].

You may also be interested in the #link("/colophon")[Colophon], where I
describe the design of the website in more detail.

= Open source licenses

In addition to stolen designs, I've also used countless lines of free and open
source libraries and programs. In particular,

- #link("https://typst.app/")[Typst] converts markup to #smallcaps[html]. (Apache 2.0)
- #link("https://www.haskell.org/")[Haskell] is what the entire site generator was written in. (#link("https://www.haskell.org/ghc/license.html")[The Glasgow Haskell Compiler License])
- The hackages #link("https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/")[Hakyll] and #link("https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-html")[blaze-html] are used for  #smallcaps(all: true)[HTML] templating and static site generation infrastructure respectively (BSD 3 clause)
- #link("https://tailwindcss.com/")[Tailwind CSS] handles all the styling. (MIT)
- The site colors are inspired by #link("https://rosepinetheme.com/")[Rosé Pine]. (MIT)
- Icons are from #link("https://lucide.dev/icons/")[Lucide]. (ISC)
