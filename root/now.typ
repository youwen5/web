This is my #link("https://nownownow.com/about")[now page], a (public) answer to
the question "what have you been up to lately?"

  And I am not a visionary. I do not have a five-year plan. I'm an engineer.
  And I think it’s really---I mean---I'm perfectly happy with all the people
  who are walking around and just staring at the clouds and looking at the
  stars and saying, "I want to go there." But I’m looking at the ground, and I
  want to fix the pothole that’s right in front of me before I fall in. This is
  the kind of person I am.

= Whereabouts

I'm studying at #link("https://www.ucsb.edu/")[#smallcaps[ucsb]] until at least
Winter 2026.

= Done and still doing

- I was in Boston/Cambridge between Sep. 7th and 15th, mostly around the MIT/Harvard area. I was a hacker at #link("https://hackmit.org/")[HackMIT] too! If you met me then, feel free to reach out to one of these #link("/#contact")[contact methods]!

= Future

- I'm still thinking of starting a project called "How #smallcaps[posix] can you get in 31 days?" where I try to write as much of a #smallcaps[posix] compliant operating system as possible, from scratch, with a 1 month time limit. Probably using Rust or Zig. I'm not sure how much time I'll have for this during the summer, though.
