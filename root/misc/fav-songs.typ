My #link("https://www.last.fm/user/couscousdude")[last.fm]. This is a heavily
non-exhaustive list. Continuously updated, hopefully.

== Artists

- #link("https://www.last.fm/music/beabadoobee")[Beabadoobee]

  Spectacular guitar work. _Beaches_ is so fun to play. _This Is How Tomorrow
  Moves_ is very good in general, actually.

- #link("https://www.last.fm/music/Ryo+Fukui")[Ryo Fukui]

  _I Want To Talk About You_ is so good.

- #link("https://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar")[Kendrick Lamar]

  No notes.

- #link("https://www.last.fm/music/Polyphia")[Polyphia]

  Virtuostic guitar work meets trap beats and hip-hop production. Listen to
  _The Worst_, _Ego Death_, and the rest of _Remember That You Will Die_. My
  biggest flex is that I can actually play one of their songs.

  )[No Party for Cao Dong (草東沒有派對)]

  The best of Taiwanese indie mandopop. Every track is a banger. A little-known song by them is the first track in #link("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_HXax8QOmw")[Devotion's original soundtrack]. It's progressive as hell.

  )[凛として時雨]

  Best known for lead singer TK's _Unravel_, the Tokyo Ghoul OST (not actually
  created as part of 凛として時雨). But the band's previous work is even
  better. Listen to
  #link("https://www.last.fm/music/%E5%87%9B%E3%81%A8%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E6%99%82%E9%9B%A8/moment+A+rhythm")[moment
    A rhythm].
