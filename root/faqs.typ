Some frequently asked and also less frequently asked questions. Updated every
once in a while. This is basically an advice page.

Before internalizing anything from this page, my foremost advice is to _ignore
all advice you don't agree with_, including this. During high school I made the
unfortunate decision to listen to the advice of many, many anonymous internet
kind strangers as well as classmates who were far more mediocre than myself.
For instance, be highly wary of advice of this form, especially in high school.

#blockquote[
  _X_ class is too hard. You should take _Y_ as an easy A.

  There's no way _X_ is possible.

  You have to be _X_ to do _Y_, and you're not _X_.
]

I am an idiot, so also be wary of advice from me.

== Programming

1. _What programming language should I learn first?_ \
  Doesn't matter. Pick a language, write some code. If you want to end up in corporate, try JavaScript or Python. If you want to be an elite hacker, try Rust or a Lisp dialect. If you don't even like programming and happen to be a mathematician, try Haskell.
2. _I don't know how to even get started with X. How can I learn?_ \
  I don't have an easy answer. But I will offer a warning.

  Be mindful of _tutorial hell_. Most people have no idea how to get started
  with most projects and naturally gravitate towards comprehensive tutorials. I
  find that you blindly follow tutorials to their end product you may not end
  up getting much out. At the very least, you should try to restart after the
  tutorial and do whatever you wanted from scratch under your own direction,
  perhaps consulting the tutorial only as a reference.

  Learning how to learn is probably harder than many concepts in undergraduate
  computer science. After you pass a certain threshold of learning ability, you
  will be able to dispense with tutorials altogether and research stacks and
  ideas which you can piece together yourself through code _samples_ and
  documentation, which is one of the most powerful skills.
3. _How can I get started with hackathons?_ \
  I think hackathons are less valuable as technical competitions and far more
  valuable as small meetups to meet hackers and build cool sh\*t. Once you stop
  thinking about winning the hackathon and just as an excuse to show up and
  make something cool, suddenly they're far more palatable. In general, I find
  that if you actually like hacking and have genuine ability, things will fall
  into place.

  Corollary: be very wary of hackathons where everyone is showing up to build
  B2B AI SaaS and have the most "impressive" looking project.
4. _How do I become cracked?_ \
  (For the boomers: cracked in this context means someone who is insanely good at programming or academics in general.)

  Well, I'm not sure I'm the right person to ask, but some people seem to
  believe I'm some level of "cracked." My general advice is to stop thinking
  about it and try to learn as much as you can whenever you can. Thinking too
  hard about these things is detrimental to your mental health. There is no formula.

  For further consideration, MIT Admissions'
  #link("https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/")[_Applying
  Sideways_] is so overrecommended but still so salient, and the general theme
  applies to so much more than just MIT admissions. Want to do _X_ which seems
  intractable? Focus on learning doing as much as you can related to _X_ for
  its own sake, and you just might end up achieving _X_. In the (honestly
  likely) event that you don't? You might achieve impressive result _Y_
  instead, and worst case you've learned and done a bunch of things which are
  fruitful in their own right.

  Also read the similar post
  #link("https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying-sideways-beyond-admissions/")[_applying
  sideways, beyond admissions_] which further expands upon this.

== School & college

1. _How's_ #smallcaps[ucsb]? \
  I think this quote sums it up nicely. I replaced all occurrences of the word "electrochemistry" with "#smallcaps[ucsb.]"
  #blockquote(
    attribution: [--- #link("https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Electrochemistry")[Electrochemistry] from _Disco Elysium_],
  )[
    Go to party planet. Love and be loved by drugs.

    Cool for: High-Fliers, Party Enthusiasts, Cops who need Lightning

    #smallcaps[ucsb] is the animal within you, the beast longing to be unleashed to indulge and enjoy. It enables you to take drugs with fewer negative side-effects. It also enables you to better investigate lurid matters – if you need to understand a chemical breakdown, or talk to someone blasted out of their mind, or understand sexual dynamics, #smallcaps[ucsb] is there to guide you.

    At high levels, #smallcaps[ucsb] makes you a man of unrestrained pleasure – an unrepentant Lothario who leers at people with a bottle of speed and a plastic bendy straw in either hand. Without a working knowledge of drugs and sex, the city will be difficult to understand.
