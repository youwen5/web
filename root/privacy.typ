We do not collect your data, except for core web vitals and analytics provided
by #link("https://www.simpleanalytics.com/")[Simple Analytics] and
#link("https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/")[Cloudflare Web Analytics].
Only minimal and anonymous data about your visit is recorded. In particular, no
cookies or #smallcaps[pii] are left on your device, and we are fully compliant
with the European Union's #smallcaps[gdpr].

We do not respect the #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track")[Do
  Not Track] signal, and frankly you shouldn't be using it anyways because it
makes you easier to fingerprint (which presumably is counter-productive).
