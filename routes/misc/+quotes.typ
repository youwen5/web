  I make my ramen the way a friend taught me in eleventh grade. Every fall, I
  listen to a playlist made for me by a boy I drove across a border to hook up
  with. I eat sushi because a girl who won’t talk to me anymore made me try it,
  and Indian food because my best friend’s parents ordered for me before I knew
  what I liked. There are movies I love because someone I loved loved them first.

  _I am a mosaic of everyone I’ve ever loved, even for a heartbeat._
