Owing to the immense, neuroscientifically engineered addictiveness of many
online platforms and programs, many people have begun realizing that they are
being adversely impacted by apps like Instagram, TikTok---the sources of
so-called #quote[brainrot.]

This has led to a slew of products angled to help you become more productive,
less brainrotted, and achieve all your goals---what I’m going to term the
#quote[productization of mindfulness.] Here, I use mindfulness to refer to the
awareness of brainrotting in one’s life along with a desire to do something
about it it.

Maybe you’ve seen those advertisements for _brick_, a device that can lock
your addcitive apps on your phone and promises to be better than the builtin
screen time feature because you can leave the #quote[brick] that unlocks them
at home. Or maybe the dumb phones where you can only make calls and texts.

Or in the digital world, where everyone is meticulously planning out their life
with Notion, Google Calendar, Pomodoro timers, and other productivity apps.

In my experience, these apps at best incrementally helpful and at worst
actively detrimental while letting you feel like you’re doing something about
your problems while you aren’t. Basically, the same effect as reading _Atomic
Habits_, finally doing laundry after, and feeling like you’re reclaiming your life.

These tools are so popular because they’re quite good at giving the _illusion_
that you’re doing something whereas in my experience any real self-improvement
must come from within oneself. If you are actually, really committed to
becoming more productive, you will be able to whether or not you rely on products
to do it. Conversely, if you rely solely on these products, you probably don’t
have real discipline yet and will fail to achieve your goals in long run
equilibrium.

Around 370 BCE, the Greek philosopher Socrates denounced the invention of writing:
#blockquote[
  For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn
  to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing,
  produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will
  discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir
  not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of
  wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and
  will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part
  ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear
  wise.
]

Most people, like I, would think this statement ludicrous at first glance.
_Writing?_ The invention invaluable to the rise of nearly all major human
scientific advancement ever? The thing I’m doing right now?

My ultimate thesis however is that Socrates was, to an extent, right.

This is not to say that these tools are not useful at all. Notion is a really
nice platform for taking notes, planning out important things in Todo apps or
Calendar is really helpful, and Pomodoro timers work well for some people.

For example, I explicitly choose not to use a calendar program, except to set reminders for
extremely important events. Meticulously organizing your life with a Google
Calendar---you’re literally ceding control to the machine.
