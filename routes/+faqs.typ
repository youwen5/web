Some frequently asked and also less frequently asked questions. Updated every once in a while.

1. _How#(apostrophe)s_ #smallcaps[ucsb]? \
  I think this quote sums it up nicely. I replaced all occurrences of the word #quote[electrochemistry] with #quote(smallcaps[ucsb.])
  #blockquote(attribution: [--- #link("https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Electrochemistry")[Electrochemistry] from _Disco Elysium_])[
    Go to party planet. Love and be loved by drugs.

    Cool for: High-Fliers, Party Enthusiasts, Cops who need Lightning

    #smallcaps[ucsb] is the animal within you, the beast longing to be unleashed to indulge and enjoy. It enables you to take drugs with fewer negative side-effects. It also enables you to better investigate lurid matters – if you need to understand a chemical breakdown, or talk to someone blasted out of their mind, or understand sexual dynamics, #smallcaps[ucsb] is there to guide you.

    At high levels, #smallcaps[ucsb] makes you a man of unrestrained pleasure – an unrepentant Lothario who leers at people with a bottle of speed and a plastic bendy straw in either hand. Without a working knowledge of drugs and sex, the city will be difficult to understand.

2. _What programming language should I learn first?_ \
  Doesn't matter. Pick a language, write some code. If you want to end up in corporate, try JavaScript or Python. If you want to be an elite hacker, try Rust or a Lisp dialect. If you don't even like programming and happen to be a mathematician, try Haskell.
