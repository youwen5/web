= Whereabouts

I’m studying at #link("https://www.ucsb.edu/")[#smallcaps[ucsb]] until at least
Winter 2026.

= Done and still doing

- I’m gonna be in Boston/Cambridge between Sep. 7th and 15th! Please reach out if you’re in the area. I’ll be at HackMIT too!

= Future

- I’m still thinking of starting a project called "How #smallcaps[posix] can you get in 31 days?" where I try to write as much of a #smallcaps[posix] compliant operating system as possible, from scratch, with a 1 month time limit. Probably using Rust or Zig. I’m not sure how much time I’ll have for this during the summer, though.

= Prose
